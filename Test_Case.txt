Enter the symbol of the element you would like to search up:
Mn                                                                  Element Symbol: Mn
                                                                    Full Name: Manganese
                                                                    Atomic Number: 25
                                                                    Atomic Mass: 54.938
                                                                    This element is in group 7 and this element is a metal
                                                                    No bonds can be formed as the element exists in groups 3-12.The elements that exist in these groups are metals and they are highly reactive. It is beyond the scope of this table to determine which elements can bond with metals to make them stable.
                                                                    Would you like to search up another element? Yes, or no?

Input 2:        Output:
No              Thank you for using the periodic table lookup

Test Case 2

Input:                                                              Output:
Enter the symbol of the element you would like to search up:         
Ci                                                                  Invalid input. The element you have entered does not exist on this table. Please try again.
                                                                    Enter the symbol of the element you would like to search up:

Test Case 3

Input:                                                                 Output:
Enter the symbol of the element you would like to search up:
Cl                                                                      Element Symbol: Cl
                                                                        Full Name: Chlorine
                                                                        Atomic Number: 17
                                                                        Atomic Mass: 35.453
                                                                        This element is in group 17 and this element is a non-metal
                                                                        This element has 1 valence electrons. This means it will bond with 1 Hydrogen atoms to become stable
                                                                        Would you like to search up another element? Yes, or no?
